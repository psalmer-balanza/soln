Hello? Is anybody there?

Chip: Raket? [wait=0.5]You know my brother??
Brother??
Chip: My name is Gilbert and my brother is Raket. [wait=1] You met my brother? But how did you get up here without waking the snake?
Well I helped the Snake get rid of his headaches by solving these inscriptions.
Chip: What?? [wait=1] This is great news! We have to tell the Wizard rat!
The Wizard rat? 
Chip: Yes the Wizard rat!  Long ago there was a prophecy where there was a chosen one who can help us all from this great darkness... but that's as far as I know.
Chip: [wait=1] The wizard rat knows more, but we need Cheddar Change to convince him to help.
Chip: I found Cheddar Change a while back but it's stuck inside this vault. 
Chip: You know how to solve these problems right? Can you open it for me?
