Brother??
Raket2: My name is Gilbert and my brother is Raket. [wait=1] You met my brother? But how did you get up here without waking the snake?
Well I helped the Snake get rid of his headaches by solving these inscriptions.
Raket2: What?? [wait=1] This is great news! We have to tell the Wizard rat!
The Wizard rat? 
Raket2: Yes the Wizard rat!  Long ago there was a prophecy where there was a chosen one who can help us all from this great darkness but that's as far as I know [wait=1] The wizard rat knows more but we need Cheddar Change to convince him to help.
Raket2: I found Cheddar Change a while back but it's stuck inside this vault. You know how to solve these problems right? Can you open it for me?
